# Base Fractal theme

## Summary
A Drupal starter theme using Fractal.

## Getting started
### Fractal setup
* Run `yarn install` to get the development dependencies.
* For the most part, you'll now want to run `yarn start` to start
  [Webpack][webpack] and [Fractal][fractal].

### Using Fractal with Drupal 
You'll need to install components so Drupal can access files in Fractal
```
lando composer require drupal/components
lando drush en components
lando drush cr
```

## Technical overview

### Static patterns

* Static pattern are developed in [Fractal][fractal] using the
  [Twig][twig] templating language.
* [Webpack][webpack] is used to compile assets into single files.


## Yarn scripts

The project provides an abundance of Yarn scripts to perform various tasks. They
are documented below.

Scripts can be run with the command `Yarn run SCRIPTNAME` with the exception of
`start` which can simply be run with `Yarn start`.

## Internal Inviqa guideline divergences

### Stylesheet guidelines
> This divergence still needs discussing with a front end TTL or SEM.

We are using the [`stylelint-config-standard`][stylelint-config-standard] Stylelint
plugin.

### Airbnb code standards

> This is not a divergence, but there is currently no documented guideline for
> JavaScript and Typescript linting.

We are using the Airbnb rules for both JavaScript and TypeScript linting.
