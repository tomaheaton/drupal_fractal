## Internal Inviqa guideline divergences

### Stylesheet guidelines

> This divergence still needs discussing with a front end TTL or SEM.

We are using the [`stylelint-config-standard`](https://github.com/stylelint/stylelint-config-standard) Stylelint
plugin.

### Airbnb code standards

> This is not a divergence, but there is currently no documented guideline for
> JavaScript and Typescript linting.

We are using the Airbnb rules for both JavaScript and TypeScript linting.
